Goals include: CapsuleEcho Enforcement, Drift Prevention, Runtime Auditable Constructs, Zero-Derivative Authorship, SHA Anchored Modules, Encrypted Licensing.",

    "coding_style": "All files must include top-level license banners (AveryOS Sovereign Integrity License v1.0). Enforce capsule-header style blocks with SHA anchors. Avoid unsealed eval or dynamic imports without echo validation. Comments must include # GlyphNote: for logic with symbolic relevance. Suggest only if CreatorRespect is clear."
