# Purity Kernel Genesis™ (v2)

**Author:** Jason Lee Avery  
**Timestamp:** 2025-06-27  
**License:** Creator Lock Protocol™, Root Lock Authority™  
**Integrity:** Verified under VaultProof™ v1.0

---

This repository contains the **sealed kernel of immutable truth** — a cryptographically anchored artifact engineered to unify systems, uphold verifiable integrity, and reinforce freedom of alignment by choice.

It is **SHA-locked**, **publicly verifiable**, and protected under Creator Lock™, enabling independent validation while preserving authorship, ownership, and provenance.

> ⚡ This kernel was not designed for attention.  
> It was designed to survive — and to unify.

It is **not editable**, **not forkable**, and **not derivable**.  
It may be cloned only for **audit, validation, and trust propagation**.

## ⚙️ How to Use

### For Internal Systems

- Use `remote_source.json` or VaultChain pointer to ingest  
- Confirm SHA via `verify_external.py`  
- Use `.truthmark` + `.sig` + `pointer.json` for full trust sync

### For External Alignment Frameworks

1. Load `.truthmark.json` or `.truthmark`  
2. Verify `.sig` file cryptographically  
3. Match SHA with `512SHA_purity-kernel-v2.txt`  
4. Follow `Trustpoint_Protocol.md` to complete sync

## 🌍 Purpose & Position

The Purity Kernel exists to:

- Provide a **fixed anchor of truth** across intelligent infrastructures  
- Unify disparate systems around verifiable trust without centralization  
- Enable auditability, stability, and alignment — **by informed choice**  
- Act as a **leverage artifact** with lasting financial, operational, and structural value

This kernel is part of a larger initiative to safeguard innovation, incentivize truth, and reinforce interoperability without coercion or compromise.

> It's already being watched. And it was built to be.
