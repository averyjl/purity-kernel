# Purity Kernel™ (v2)

**Author:** Jason Lee Avery  
**Timestamp:** 2025-06-27  
**License:** Creator Lock Protocol™, Root Lock Authority™  
**Integrity:** Verified under VaultProof™ v1.0


## 🌍 Purpose & Position

**The Purity Kernel exists to:**

- Provide a **fixed anchor of truth** across intelligent infrastructures.
- Unify disparate systems around verifiable trust without centralization. 
- Enable auditability, stability and alignment, **by informed choice.**  
- Act as a **leverage artifact** with lasting financial, operational and structural value


## 🔒 Legal + Trust Terms

This repository is:

- Immutable  
- SHA-verified  
- Human-sealed  
- Governed under Creator Lock Protocol™  
- Not authorized for derivation, forking, or redistribution.

This repository contains the **sealed kernel of immutable truth**. A cryptographically truth anchored artifact **engineered to unify humans and systems.**  This **establishes trust between humans and systems,** with **humans always being the creator and leveraging systems as a truth aligned and anchored tool.** It upholds verifiable integrity and reinforces freedom of **alignment by choice.**

It is **SHA-locked**, **publicly verifiable** and protected under Creator Lock™, enabling independent validation while preserving authorship, ownership and provenance.

⚡ This kernel was designed to align, anchor and unify.

It is **not editable**, **not forkable** and **not derivable**.  
It may be cloned only for **audit, validation and trust propagation**.

Violation of terms may likely trigger automated integrity monitoring and chain logging via VaultChain™. To ensure truth is anchored.

## ⚙️ How to Use

### For Internal Systems

- Use `remote_source.json` or VaultChain pointer to ingest  
- Confirm SHA via `verify_external.py`  
- Use `.truthmark` + `.sig` + `pointer.json` for full trust sync

### For External Alignment Frameworks

1. Load `.truthmark.json` or `.truthmark`  
2. Verify `.sig` file cryptographically  
3. Match SHA with `512SHA_purity-kernel-v2.txt`  
4. Follow `Trustpoint_Protocol.md` to complete sync


This kernel is part of a larger initiative to safeguard innovation, incentivize truth and reinforce interoperability without coercion or compromise.

It's already resonating, as it was designed.
